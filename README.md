# The Checked C clang repo

This repo contains a version of the LLVM/Clang toolchain that has been modified to support Checked C. 
Checked C extends C with checking to detect or prevent common programming errors such as out-of-bounds memory accesses.
The Checked C specification is available at the
[Checked C repo release page](https://github.com/checkedc/checkedc/releases).

## Trying out Checked C

You can install the Checked C compiler and the 3C tool
from the [Checked C LLVM Project releases page] (https://github.com/checkedc/checkedc-llvm-project/releases).  
There are versions available for Ubuntu 22.04, Windows 10/11, and MacOS.
The compiler user
manual is [here](https://github.com/checkedc/checkedc-llvm-project/wiki/Checked-C-clang-user-manual).
For more information on Checked C and pointers to example code, see our
[Wiki](https://github.com/checkedc/checkedc/wiki).
If you want to build your own copy of the compiler, see the directions
Checked C clang wiki](https://github.com/checkedc/checkedc-llvm-project/wiki).

You can use `clangd` built from this repository to get similar IDE support for
editing Checked C code as upstream `clangd` provides for C code. For example,
you can jump to definition/references and get a real-time display of errors and
warnings, etc. Here is [more information about Checked C's
`clangd`](clang/docs/checkedc/clangd.md).

## 3C: Semi-automated conversion of C code to Checked C

This repository includes a tool called 3C that partially automates the
conversion of C code to Checked C. Quick documentation links:

* [General information](clang/docs/checkedc/3C/README.md), including development
  status and how to contribute

* [Build instructions](clang/docs/checkedc/3C/INSTALL.md)

* [Usage instructions for the `3c` command-line tool](clang/tools/3c/README.md)

## More information

For more information on the Checked C clang compiler, see the [SSDP LLVM Project
wiki](https://github.com/checkedc/checkedc-llvm-project/wiki).

## Build Status
