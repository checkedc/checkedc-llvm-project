// The compilation database used for this test includes two entries for this
// file, causing 3C to process it twice. In issue #661, this caused type
// argument instantiation to fail.

// This issue also made an erroneous entry appear in the root cause output. The
// root cause did not appear in the -warn-root-cause warnings. It was only
// present in the root cause statistics json output. The json is used to
// generate the output for 3c-wrap root_cause, so the error appeared there as well.

// Furthermore, in stdout mode, if the main file was processed twice, the
// rewritten version was printed to stdout twice
// (https://github.com/correctcomputation/checkedc-clang/issues/374#issuecomment-893612654).
// Check that this doesn't happen any more.
